Unemployment Rate Analysis in India
This project analyzes the unemployment rate across various states and regions of India using data on employment, unemployment, and labor participation rates. The analysis includes visualizations and statistical insights to better understand regional disparities in unemployment and employment trends over time.

Dataset
The dataset, "Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv," includes the following columns:

States: Name of the states in India.
Date: Date when the data was recorded.
Frequency: Frequency at which the data is recorded.
Estimated Unemployment Rate: Estimated unemployment rate of the state.
Estimated Employed: Estimated number of employed individuals.
Estimated Labour Participation Rate: Proportion of the working-age population either employed or seeking employment.
Region: Geographical region to which the state belongs.
Longitude: Geographical longitude of the state.
Latitude: Geographical latitude of the state.
Project Overview
The project performs the following tasks:

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the dataset by renaming columns for better readability.
Checked for missing values and handled discrepancies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Distribution of Estimated Employed and Estimated Unemployment Rate across regions.
Interactive Sunburst plot visualizing unemployment by regions and states.
Pie chart showing the proportion of data from each region.
